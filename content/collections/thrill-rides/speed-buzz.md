            text: "\_is a\_Booster\_built by Dutch manufacturer\_KMG. This ride can hold up to 8 people at once, two gondolas each with two rows of two riders facing back-to-back. Passengers climb into the gondolas which then spin up to the top of the ride while the next passengers climb on board. When the ride is full and ready to go it spins around like a pendulum, while you enjoy dizzying views and adrenaline rushes. "
