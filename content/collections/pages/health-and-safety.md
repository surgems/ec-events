            text: "All our rides are tested annually by a fully certified ADIPS inspector, tests carried out are electrical, functional and NDT (non-destructive test). The ride is further inspected on every setup and before the operation, by our in house team, any repairs needed are carried out by them immediately on-site and recorded in the maintenance logbook. Each ride has its own specific risk assessment which is reviewed annually. \_Our customer's safety is our number one priority!"
