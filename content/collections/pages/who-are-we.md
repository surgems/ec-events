Alan’s sons have expanded the business with large roller coasters, giant observation wheels and thrill rides, touring festivals and events in Europe, UK and the Middle East. Whilst they still organise and operate traditional fairs along with providing all kinds of rides, they have driven the business forward into the modern era. Christmas markets, music festivals, beach-themed events, pop up theme parks and stand-alone attractions in tourist hotspots just to name a few! Today the Crow family are one of the UK’s leading events and attractions specialists now with over 150 years of experience in the business.'
